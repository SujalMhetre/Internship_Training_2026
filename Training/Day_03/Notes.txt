Day 03 – List Tags & Frameset

1. List Tags in HTML

Lists are used to display related items in a structured and readable form.
HTML supports three types of lists.

a) Ordered List (<ol>)

- Used when the order of items matters
- Items are displayed in a numbered sequence (1, 2, 3…)
Common use cases:
  * Steps in a process
  * Ranking or priority-based content
  * Instructions or procedures

Each item inside an ordered list is represented using a list item tag.

b) Unordered List (<ul>)

- Used when order does NOT matter
- Items are displayed using bullets (•)
- Common use cases:
   * Navigation menus
   * Feature lists
   * General grouping of items

Each item is also written using the list item tag.

c) Description List (<dl>)

- Used to represent terms and their descriptions
- Common use cases:
   * Definitions
   * Glossaries
   * Key–value type information

It consists of:
- A term
- A description related to that term

Why Lists Are Important

- Improve content readability
- Help structure data clearly
- Widely used in menus, forms, and layouts
- Enhance accessibility and SEO

2. Frameset in HTML

Frameset was used to divide a browser window into multiple sections, where each section could load a different HTML document.

  Note: Frameset is deprecated and not used in modern web development, but understanding it is useful for legacy projects.

What is a Frameset?

- Frameset replaces the <body> tag
- It allows splitting the page into:
   * Rows
   * Columns
- Each section (frame) loads a separate HTML file

Common Uses of Frameset (Earlier)

- Showing navigation in one frame and content in another
- Keeping header or sidebar static while content changes
- Multi-page layouts without reloading the full page

Disadvantages of Frameset

- Poor SEO support
- Difficult to maintain
- Bad user experience (scrolling, bookmarking issues)
- Not supported in HTML5

Because of these issues, framesets are now replaced by:

- CSS layouts
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Modern UI frameworks

Key Learning from Frameset

- Helped understand page division concepts
- Introduced the idea of separating layout and content
- Laid foundation for modern layout techniques

Day 03 Summary

- Understood how frameset worked and why it is obsolete
- Gained clarity on structuring content effectively
