Day 05 – JavaScript (Validation)

🔹 Validation in JavaScript

- Validation means checking user input before processing it
- Validation ensures data is correct, complete, and usable
- Validation helps prevent errors in applications
- Validation improves user experience
- Validation increases system reliability

🔹 Why Validation is Important

- Prevents invalid data entry
- Avoids system crashes and bugs
- Maintains data quality
- Improves application stability
- Protects application logic

🔹 Types of Validation

- Empty validation (input should not be blank)
- Length validation (minimum / maximum characters)
- Type validation (number, string, email, etc.)
- Format validation (email format, phone format)
- Range validation (value within limit)
- Logical validation (valid values like age > 0)

🔹 Validation Flow

- User enters data
- Event is triggered (submit / click / input)
- Validation logic executes
- Data is checked
- If invalid → error message shown
- If valid → data accepted

🔹 Real-life Examples

- Username cannot be empty
- Password must be minimum length
- Email must be in correct format
- Age must be a number
- Phone number must be valid length
