Day 09 Internship Task Notes
Topic: Bootstrap Container, Grid System & Card Layout

====================================
BOOTSTRAP BASICS
====================================
Bootstrap is a front-end CSS framework used to build responsive and modern UI quickly.

Key Concepts:
- Uses pre-written CSS classes
- No need to write CSS for basic styling
- Class-based design system
- Responsive by default
- Mobile-first approach

CDN Concept:
- Bootstrap CDN links load CSS and JS directly from the internet
- Enables Bootstrap features without downloading files

====================================
CONTAINER SYSTEM
====================================
Containers are used to structure and center content.

Types:
- container → fixed-width responsive container
- container-fluid → full-width container

Purpose:
- Adds padding automatically
- Centers content
- Maintains layout alignment
- Controls page width

Example:
<div class="container">...</div>

====================================
GRID SYSTEM
====================================
Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid system.

Structure:
container → row → column

Key Classes:
- row → creates horizontal layout row
- col → column
- col-12 → full width
- col-md-6 → half width
- col-md-4 → one-third width

Responsive Classes:
- col-12 → mobile
- col-md-* → tablet
- col-lg-* → desktop

Purpose:
- Responsive layouts
- Automatic alignment
- Clean structure
- Device adaptability

====================================
CARD COMPONENT
====================================
Cards are pre-designed content boxes in Bootstrap.

Main Classes:
- card
- card-img-top
- card-body
- card-title
- card-text
- btn btn-primary

Structure:
card → image → body → title → text → button

Purpose:
- Display content
- Product cards
- Profile cards

====================================
STYLING CONCEPT
====================================
Bootstrap provides default styling automatically.

Custom CSS is used only for:
- Custom colors
- Shadows
- Hover effects
- Animations
- Branding
- Unique UI design

Concept:
Bootstrap = Structure + Styling + Responsiveness
Developer = Layout logic + class usage

====================================
