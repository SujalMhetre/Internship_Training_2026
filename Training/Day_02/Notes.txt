Day 02 – HTML Forms & Tables

1. Forms in HTML
What is a Form?

A form is used to collect input from users and send that data to a server.

Forms are commonly used for:

- login pages
- signup pages
- contact forms
- feedback forms

* <form> Tag

The <form> tag wraps all input elements and controls how data is sent.

Important attributes:

- action → where the form data goes
- method → how the data is sent

* GET → data visible in URL

* POST → data sent securely

Common Form Elements

- input → takes user input (text, email, password, etc.)
- label → describes the input field (improves clarity & accessibility)
- textarea → multi-line text input
- select & option → dropdown list
- button → submits the form

Why Form Validation Matters

Validation ensures:

- required fields are filled
- correct data format is entered
- bad or empty input is avoided

* This improves:

- user experience
- data quality

Why Forms Are Important

- enable user interaction
- collect data
- essential for dynamic websites

2. Tables in HTML
What is a Table?

A table is used to display structured data in rows and columns.

- Common use cases:
- user lists
- reports
- marksheets
- product details

Table Structure

- table → main container
- tr → table row
- th → table heading
- td → table data

* <th> vs <td>

- <th> → column or row heading
- <td> → actual data

When to Use Tables

Use tables when:

- data is structured
- comparison is needed
- rows and columns make sense

When NOT to Use Tables

- for page layout
- for design purposes
Use CSS instead.
