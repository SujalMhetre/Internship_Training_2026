Day 01 – HTML Basics and Tags

1. What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is used to create and structure web pages.

HTML tells the browser:

- what is a heading
- what is a paragraph
- what is a link
- what is an image

HTML is used only for structure, not for styling or logic.

Role in Web Development:
- HTML -> Structure
- CSS -> Styling
- JavaScript -> Behavior

2. HTML Element

An HTML element usually contains:

- an opening tag
- some content
- a closing tag

Some elements do not have a closing tag.These are called empty elements.

3. HTML Tags

HTML tags are written inside angle brackets < >.
Tags are used to define elements and content on a web page.

4. Types of HTML Tags

A. Paired Tags

- Have both opening and closing tags
- Used when content is present

Examples:

- headings
- paragraphs
- links

B. Unpaired (Self-Closing) Tags

- Do not have closing tags
- Used to insert content

Examples:

- image
- line break
- input

5. Block-Level Elements

- Always starts on a new line
- Take full width available of the page

Examples:

- heading
- paragraph
- div
- section

6. Inline Elements

- Do not start on a new line
- Take only required space

Examples:

- span
- anchor
- strong
- emphasis

7. Semantic HTML Tags

Semantic tags clearly describe the meaning of the content.

Examples:

- header
- nav
- section
- article
- footer
- main

Advantages of semantic tags:

- Code is easy to read
- Better for SEO
- Improves accessibility

8. Non-Semantic Tags

These tags do not clearly describe their meaning.

Examples:

- div
- span

HTML Attributes

Attributes provide extra information about an element.

Common attributes:

* id -> unique identification
* class -> group of elements
* style -> inline styling
* title -> extra information

Common HTML Mistakes

- Using div everywhere instead of semantic tags
- Skipping heading order
- Forgetting alt text in images
- Using HTML for styling instead of CSS.
