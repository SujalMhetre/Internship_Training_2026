Day 04 – JavaScript(intro,if-else,loops,arrays)

🔹 Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive
- It runs inside the browser
- JavaScript is used for:
    * Handling user actions
    * Making decisions
    * Manipulating data
- Difference between:
    * HTML → Structure of the webpage
    * CSS → Styling of the webpage
    * JavaScript → Logic and behavior of the webpage

🔹 JavaScript Variables

- A variable is used to store data values
- Variables help reuse and manipulate data
- Types of variables in JavaScript:
   * var
   * let
   * const
- Difference between let and const:
   * let → value can be changed
   * const → value cannot be changed
   * Rules for naming variables:
   * Must start with a letter, _ or $
   * Cannot use keywords
   * Case-sensitive

🔹 Conditional Statements (if–else)

- Conditional statements are used to make decisions
- The program executes different code based on conditions
- Types of conditional statements:
   * if
   * if–else
   * else–if ladder
- Comparison operators:
   * >, <, >=, <=
   * ==, ===
- Logical operators:
   * AND (&&)
   * OR (||)

Real-life example to mention:
- Checking eligibility for voting
- Checking pass or fail

🔹 Loops in JavaScript

- Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times
- Types of loops:
   * for loop
   * while loop
   * do–while loop
- Difference:
   * for → when number of iterations is known
   * while → condition-based loop
   * do–while → runs at least once
- Loops help reduce code repetition

🔹 Arrays in JavaScript

- An array is a data structure that stores multiple values
- Array elements are accessed using index numbers
- Index starts from 0
- Arrays are useful for storing:
   * Numbers
   * Strings
   * Multiple related values
- Common operations:
   * Accessing elements
   * Updating values
   * Finding array length

🔹 Day 04 Summary
